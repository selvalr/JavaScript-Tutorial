      /*
      Code Debugging
      Programming code might contain syntax errors, or logical errors.

      Many of these errors are difficult to diagnose.

      Often, when programming code contains errors, nothing will happen. There are no error messages, and you will get no indications where to search for errors.

      Searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called code debugging.

      /*
  JavaScript Debuggers
Debugging is not easy. But fortunately, all modern browsers have a built-in JavaScript debugger.

Built-in debuggers can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported to the user.

With a debugger, you can also set breakpoints (places where code execution can be stopped), and examine variables while the code is executing.

Normally (otherwise follow the steps at the bottom of this page), you activate debugging in your browser with the F12 key, and select "Console" in the debugger menu.

      b = 7;
      c = a + b;
      console.log(c);

      /*
      The debugger Keyword
The debugger keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function.

This has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the debugger.

If no debugging is available, the debugger statement has no effect.

With the debugger turned on, this code will stop executing before it executes the third line.
