        JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed:

        // How to create variables:
        var x;
        let y;

        // How to use variables:
        x = 5;
        y = 6;
        let z = x + y;

/*
JavaScript Values

1.Fixed values
2.Variable values

Fixed values are called Literals.

Variable values are called Variables.

*/

//1.JavaScript Literals

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 10.5; //Numbers are written with or without decimals:
document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "John Doe"; //Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:

//2.JavaScript Variables

let x2;
x2 = 6;
document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = x2;
